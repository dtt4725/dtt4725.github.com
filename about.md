I graduated from HuNan University, start my first QA job in Beijing Join Cheer software company. I'm just a new guy but my manager trust me and let me config and manage Jira for the whole company, I really learned a lot, also I love testing&file bugs from there. Anyway, I have to work overtime nearly every day and it's not a good thing for me, I met my (last^^) bf there and then god married~, that's sweet memory. Then I joined Symantec SORT team . I love this company ,it gave me a chance to express my technology skill while not limit my work time, also make friends with lots of talent colleagues. It's the first time I feel that I can have a good job plus a good life in the same time. I learned Automation testing here and become one core member in Auto team. although change role to a 'foreign guy' is not easy for me, I got promoted and 'Outstanding' in my 2013's personal review, I think it's the best award for my effort. I left Symantec at the end of 2013, in order to have a better personal development. I joined Oracle SRM team then, it's a new&young team, change from Java to Ruby, start to use github manage code, so many dificulties at the first time, but I know I must keep learning. My manager ask me take business trip to US for one month, I think it's a positive feedback for my hard work. the job is interested and I can learn a lot new techs from it, but the disordered management makes me so unhappy, lots of friends in my team choose to leave, I'm just the next one. Oracle ends with a sad memory... I took a long time for rest, get my new job in Cisco. New chance new start. Now, it's time to shine again!~~
