I graduated from HuNan University, start my QA job in Beijing Join Cheer software company. I'm just a new guy at that time, but my manager trust me and let me config and manage Jira for the whole company, I really learned a lot, also I love test&file bugs from there. Anyway, I need to work overtime nearly every and it's not a good thing for me, I met my (last^^) bf there and then god married~, that's sweet memory. Then at 2011 I joined Symantec as Assoc software engineer, work in SORT team and become QA engineer next year, I love this company ,it gave me a platform to express my technology but not limit my work time, it's the first time I feel I can have a good job + a good life in the same time. Also I learned Automation testing here and become one major member in Auto team. although change role as a 'foreign guy' is not a easy thing for me, I got 'Outstanding' in my 2013's personal review, I think it's the best award for my effort. I left Symantec at the end of 2013, in order to have a better personal development I joined Oracle SRM team, switch to a new&young team, change from Java to Ruby, start to use github manage code, so many dificulties at the first time, but thank god I found my own pace now and I know I must keep learning...
