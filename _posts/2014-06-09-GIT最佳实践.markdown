###Clone GitHub Repo to local machine

    git clone git@github.com:vitrue/sina_weibo.git

###Get the latest code of specific branch (such as develop)

1- switch to the branch you want to checkout from

    git checkout develop

2- get changes from remote repo

    git fetch
    git fetch origin remotebranch (only fetch specific branch)

3- update develop branch to the latest code

    git merge origin/develop

4- you can do step2 and step3 in one step (not recommend)
    git pull origin develop ( this develop branch is remote branch)

5- you can also do step 1-3 in one step (not recommend)
    git pull origin develop:develop (git pull (remote repo) (remote branch name):(local branch name))

###Usually we create a new branch based on an existing branch (such as develop)
1- create a new branch based on current branch (such as develop, see above 'Get the latest code of specific branch' )

    git checkout develop , then pull/fetch+merge an the latest code
    git checkout -b tingting/new_branch
    

----------
    

###Add new file, then push to remote server
1- make sure you are on right branch, check the git status
2- add file to track a file with git 

    git add <relative_file_path>
    or
    git add . (add all changed file, not recommend)

3- commit your changes to git

    git commit -m "your comment on this commit"

4- sync to GitHub

    git push origin <new_branch>

###Rebase, sometimes ,there have confilction, so must do rebase first then merge

1- try to rebase the branch (usually we are on other branch, and we rebase from develop)

    git fetch
    git checkout tingting/abc
    git rebase origin/develop
    >May tell you there are some conficts
    vi <file_nameto solve conflicts
    git add <file_name>
    >continue or abort
    git rebase --continue
    or
    git rebase --abort
    
    after rebase finished, push the latest code to github (need force push)
    git push origin tingting/abs -f


###Delete the branch

    git branch -d tingting/new_branch
    git branch -D tingting/new_branch  (force delete)

###Check the status
    git status

###Check log
    git log

###Reset file (when you want to give up all changes and let the file or commit back to origin status)
    git log  (get the SHA code for your desire commit)
    git reset <SHA code>



###Set an tracking relationship between remote and local branch manually
    git branch --track localtrack origin/master (new a branch named localtrack, this branch will track the remote master branch, that's mean when you do pull or push on localtrach, it will go to origin/master)

    when you set the tracking relationship, you can omit the parameter of this branch of command pull/push/...
    git pull
    git push

----------


###Notice the order of pull and push
    git pull origin <remote branch>: <local branch>
    git push origin <local branch>: <remote branch>

###Current process:
    1- push your code to github, then send pull request via GitHub
    2- reviewers review your code and give comments
    3- coder resolves all comments till add reviewers say "Good to merge"
    4- click the button on GitHub to merge your branch into develop
    5- delete your branch
